Webpkr provides:

.Declarative builds
The core of Webpack is a _domain specific language_ (DSL) which lets you write JavaScript build scripts, rather than monolithic JavaScript objects. Webpkr provides declarative language elements which you can assemble as you like. Simply `require` reusable code to include it in your build.

.Structure your build
Webpkr makes it very easy to structure your build from reusable pieces of build logic, letting you partition code logically.

.Multi-environment builds
Webpak lets you target multiple environments (e.g. development, production) in the same build script so that you have a single truth of build logic. You no longer need to clone your base build for development and production.
