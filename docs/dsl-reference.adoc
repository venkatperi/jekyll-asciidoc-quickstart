= webpkr Build Language Reference
:showtitle:
:page-permalink: /dsl-reference/

Webpkr scripts are _configuration scripts_. As the script executes, it configures a tree of configuration nodes. During the evaluation phase, tree nodes are evaluated to generate a `webpack` configuration object.

[WARNING]
Under Development.

== Script Structure
A configuration script is made of up of multiple statements and script blocks. A script block inserts a new node in the the _configuration tree_ and takes optional parameters.

.Configuration Closure
If the final parameter is a closure, it is treated as a _configuration closure_ which configures the newly created node. Any optional parameters are available to the node during the subsequent evaluation phase.

```javascript
// optional arguments
block([{*}, ..., {*},] () => {
    // configuration closure
})
```

.Naming Convention
Top level script blocks map to top level keys of the `webpack` configuration object. Where there is a potential clash of names (e.g. with `module` or `path`), the script block name is appended with a `$` symbol.

.Plain Ol' JavaScript
The build script is JavaScript code, and can contain any valid JavaScript, such as method definitions, `require` statements, classes etc.

== Globals

[.code-header]
=== projectDir
[.lead]
The directory containing the project build file. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = require( 'webpkr' )( { projectDir: __dirname } );

```
[.code-header]
=== buildDir
[.lead]
The build directory of this project where all the output will be generated. Defaults to `projectDir/build`.

== multiple Environments

[.lead]
Environment script blocks allow conditional inclusion (or exclusion) during the evaluation phase based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.


[.code-header]
=== development()
Sub-blocks are evaluated only when `NODE_ENV=development`.

```javascript
development( () => {
  // development-only scripts
})
```

[.code-header]
=== production()
Sub-blocks are evaluated only when `NODE_ENV=production`.

```javascript
production( () => {
  // production-only scripts
})
```

[.code-header]
=== testing()
Sub-blocks are evaluated only when `NODE_ENV=testing`.

```javascript
testing( () => {
  // testing-only scripts
})
```

[.code-header]
=== staging()
Sub-blocks are evaluated only when `NODE_ENV=staging`.

```javascript
staging( () => {
  // staging-only scripts
})
```

== Evaluation Order

[.lead]
In some cases, it may be necessary to control the order the order of evaluation, e.g. to ensure the order of loading of css files.

[IMPORTANT]
Do not depend solely on the position of a script block if order of evaluation is important.

[.code-header]
=== doFirst()
Instructs the evaluation phase to evaluate the nodes contained within before other nodes.


```javascript
// ensures that base.css is loaded before style.css

entry({main: './css/style.css'})

doFirst( () => {
  entry({main: './css/base.css'})
})

```


[.code-header]
=== doLast()
Instructs the evaluation phase to evaluate the nodes contained within after other nodes.

```javascript
// ensures that style.css is loaded after base.css

doLast( () => {
  entry({main: './css/style.css'})
})

entry({main: './css/base.css'})
```

[NOTE]
The order of evaluation within `doFirst` and `doLast` is not guaranteed.

== Entry and Context

[.code-header]
=== context( )
`string`

The base directory for resolving entry points and loaders from configuration. Relative paths are resolved from `projectDir`.

```javascript
context('src')
// => projectDir/src
```

[.code-header]
=== entry()
`string | [string] | object { <key>: string | [string] }`

The point or points to enter the application. See link:https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#entry[entry]. Webpkr will merge multiple calls to `entry()`:

- Arrays will be merged with arrays or individual strings.
- Objects will merged/extended by key.

[WARNING]
Attempting to merge an array with an object will result in an error.

```

```javascript

```
|===


== Output
[.lead]
The top-level `output` script block configures `webpack` output settings.

```javascript
output(() =>{
  filename( 'bundle.js' )
  path$( 'dist' )
} )
```

[NOTE]
====
To avoid potential name clashes, `output.path` is available as `path$`.

== Module

[.lead]
The top-level `module$` script block configures the `webpack` module key.

```javascript
module$( () => {
  rule( () => { } )
  rule( () => { } )
} )
```

[NOTE]
====
To avoid name clashes, `output.path` is available as `path$`.
====


[.code-header]
=== rule()

The `rule` script block defines a rule which is matched to requests when modules are created. Rule blocks are grouped into the `module.rules` array during the evaluation phase.

```javascript
module$( () => {

  rule( () => {
    test( /\.css$/ )
    use( ExtractTextPlugin.extract( {
      fallback: 'style-loader',
      use: 'css-loader',
    } ) )
  } )

  rule( () => {
    test( /\.scss$/ )
    use( ExtractTextPlugin.extract( {
      fallback: 'style-loader',
      use: [
        { loader: 'css-loader' },
        { loader: 'sass-loader' },
      ]
    } ) )
  } )
} )
```
